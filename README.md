# Go AWS

Is a simple library to aid in AWS account monitoring and management. 

This utility allows a quick _account_ level snapshot of an AWS
account. At this point it scans instances, volumes and snapshots.

It is also capable of cleaning up instances and volumes.  This utility
was used to clean up some hacked accounts that incurred an overnight
attack and spin up of 431 odd Virtual Machines.
